# 📊 SDG –: NO POVERTY  

## 🌍 **Abstract**
Sustainable Development Goal 1 (No Poverty) aims to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce inequalities by improving access to resources, financial support, education, and employment. Probability and Statistics plays a crucial role in analyzing poverty data, identifying risk groups, predicting future poverty levels, and evaluating the effectiveness of government schemes. This project applies statistical tools to understand income distribution patterns and poverty trends in selected regions.

## 📘 **Introduction**
Poverty remains one of the major global concerns. Statistical analysis helps policymakers and researchers:
- Understand poverty distribution
- Identify socio-economic risk factors
- Evaluate the impact of welfare programs

In this study, we use statistical methods such as **mean, variance, standard deviation, probability distribution, correlation, and regression** to analyze poverty-related data and derive meaningful insights.

---

## 📚 **Literature Review**
Previous research shows:
- Poverty is deeply linked with education, employment, and social welfare.
- Statistical modeling helps predict poverty rates and assess policy outcomes.
- Probability distributions help quantify uncertainty in income and expenditure patterns.

This forms the basis for selecting **statistical models** for the present study.

## ✅ **Objective**
To analyze poverty-related data using statistical techniques to:
- Identify the level of income inequality
- Understand relationships between socio-economic indicators
- Predict poverty trends with regression-based forecasting

## 🧮 **Statistical Calculations (Example Format)**

| Parameter | Value |
|---------|------|
| Mean Income | 12,500 ₹ |
| Median Income | 10,200 ₹ |
| Standard Deviation | 4,350 ₹ |
| Probability of Income < Poverty Line | 0.42 |

> *This means around 42% of the surveyed population is below the defined poverty threshold.*

---

## 📉 **Regression Result (Example)**
**Regression Equation:**  
\[
Income = 5200 + 310(Education Level)
\]

> Interpretation: Higher education level positively impacts income, reducing poverty likelihood.

---

## 📝 **Conclusion**
This study demonstrates how **Probability and Statistics** helps analyze poverty patterns and predict socio-economic outcomes. The results highlight the importance of **education, employment, and government support** in poverty reduction. With proper policies and targeted planning, poverty levels can be significantly reduced over time.
